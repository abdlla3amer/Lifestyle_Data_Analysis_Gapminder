3. Employment rate % (females aged 15+).


## Criteria:
1. Using Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Jupyter Notebook, collect, assess and clean the datasets.
2. Using Descriptive Statistics and Data Visualization, conduct your open ended Exploratory Data Analysis for each indicator individually and between the three indicators.
3. Draw your conclusions about your analysis.
4. Share your findings and communicate your results using Jupyter Notebook.
